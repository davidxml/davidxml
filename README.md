# 👋 Hey there, I'm **David Adewunmi**  

💡 *Computer Science Student | Aspiring AI & Robotics Engineer | Techpreneur in progress*  

I’m passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Robotics, and building autonomous systems that think, learn, and move like living intelligence.  

I got into tech when I fell in love with autonomous systems, especially the early self-driving cars that were being built at the time. I loved mechatronics, but soon discovered that I enjoy writing the code myself and being in control of how the system behaves.  

What keeps me going is the belief that one day with consistent efforts I will be finally able to build the intelligent systems I have always wanted to build.

## 💼 Software Development Internship @ Saiket Systems  

During my internship at Saiket Systems, I worked on a series of projects that strengthened my foundation as a developer.  
I designed tools, consumed APIs, built front-end apps, and improved my understanding of modular programming.  
It was a hands-on experience that taught me to think like an engineer, not just a coder.  

**Highlights:**  
- Built an EMI Calculator, API Data Fetcher, and Contact Book using Python  
- Created a Front-End Blog App with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- Practiced clean coding, debugging, and version control with Git  
- Worked with modular design, input validation, and client-side storage  

This internship shaped how I approach problem-solving and helped me see software as a way to design real-world impact.

## 🛰️ My Vision  

To build intelligent systems that can **perceive**, **reason**, and **act** — shaping a world where humans and machines work together in harmony.  
I’m inspired by the limitless potential of AI and robotics to transform security, mobility, and exploration.
